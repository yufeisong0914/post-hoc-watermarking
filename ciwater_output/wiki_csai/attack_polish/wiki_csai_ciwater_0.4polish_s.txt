['These statements are often referred to as "propositions"or"atomic formulas" because they cannot be broken down into simpler components.']
['This is utilized to depict the dynamic behavior of a system, where the present state relies on the actions of the decision maker and the probabilistic outcomes of those actions.', 'An MDP is characterized by a set of states, a set of actions, and a transition function that delineates the probabilistic results of taking a specific action in a particular state.', 'You can achieve this through methods like dynamic programming or reinforcement learning.']
['Imperfect information refers to a situation in which one or more players in a decision-making process or game lack complete information about the available options or the consequences of their actions.', 'Put simply, the players might lack a full grasp of the situation and thus need to make choices with only partial or restricted information.', 'This concept holds significance in game theory, economics, and various other fields that investigate decision-making under uncertainty.']
['These computers were designed to reason, learn, and adapt to new situations in a manner similar to human thinking and problem-solving.', 'Examples of fifth-generation computers include the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) project, a 1980s research initiative funded by the Japanese government aimed at developing advanced AI-based computer systems. Another example is the IBM Deep Blue computer, which achieved fame as a fifth-generation computer by defeating the world chess champion in 1997.']
['Edge detection is an image processing technique used to identify the boundaries of objects within images.', 'Various techniques exist for conducting edge detection, including the Sobel operator, the Canny edge detector, and the Laplacian operator.', 'Each of these methods operates by analyzing the pixel values in an image and comparing them based on a predetermined set of criteria to determine whether a pixel is likely to be an edge pixel or not.']
